## Description
Inspired by the classic hit Flappy Bird developed by Dong Nguyen, a game that will test your reflexes and patience. 
Being a fan of horror aesthetic visuals, I recreate this game by replacing the famous bird with a ghost character floating through the obstacles trying to reach to the end of a classroom hallway.

## Analysis of Code

- DOM Events allow JavaScript to add event listener or event handlers to HTML elements.
- The player clicks on the element to trigger the function

- innerHTML is a property of the element that allows you to get or set the HTML markup contained within the element. 
- This was pass through the function of gameEnd so that the message only appears when condition are met.
