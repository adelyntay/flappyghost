## Description
Inspired by the classic hit Flappy Bird developed by Dong Nguyen, a game that will test your reflexes and patience. 

Being a fan of horror aesthetic visuals, I recreate this game by replacing the famous bird with a ghost character floating through the obstacles trying to reach to the end of a classroom hallway.
