## Description
Inspired by the classic hit Flappy Bird developed by Dong Nguyen, a game that will test your reflexes and patience. 

Being a fan of horror aesthetic visuals, I recreate this game by replacing the famous bird with a ghost character floating through the obstacles trying to reach to the end of a classroom hallway.

###### Pseudocode for the overall game play

Initialize game state and variables
Repeat until game is over:
Update character and pillar positions
Check for collisions 
If player input is received (click):
Change character state and pillar positions
Update score
If game over condition is met:
End game and show restart button
Wait for next frame

###### Manipulating HTML DOM 

- innerHTML to show the message when game ends
- removeEventListener to stop the player using mouse click event to control the ghost
